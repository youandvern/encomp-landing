      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <p>
        Our original engineering calculation platform, efficalc, has been thoughtfully designed to
        optimize design calculation workflows for engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write your inputs and equations like you would by hand and don't waste time with the
        formatting. Then efficalc will automate the formatting and generate everything you need
        throughout the lifecycle of the calculation.
      </p>
